## Description
{
In this project I will be building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
}
## Setup/Installation Requirements

Use Google Colab for data preparation and analysis.

Import pandas, Numpy libraries,  seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, math, pandas_profiling, PolynomialFeatures, train_test_split, LinearRegression,  train_test_split,GridSearchCV, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, confusion_matrix

Loading datasets and previewing datasets.

Cleaning data

 Experimental design taken Perform your EDA
 
Perform any necessary feature engineering

Check of multicollinearity

Building a model

Approach 1: Decision Trees: Random Forests , Ada Boosted Trees , Gradient Boosted Trees
 
Approach 2: Support Vector Machines: Kernel = polynomial , linear , rbf
  
Challenging the solution

## Known Bugs
No known bugs.

## Technologies Used
The analysis was carried out in python using pandas and numpy.
